<h1>What is this place?</h1>

<p class="lead">Welcome! London Beer Space is your new home for craft beer events in London, and we'll be working hard to improve it as quickly as possible. This site will be as great as you make itâ€”we're relying on London's craft beer bars, breweries, and events organisers to add their events here for everyone to find.</p>
<p class="lead">We'll be adding more features in the coming weeks, so feel free to <a href="#" ui-sref="contact">provide feedback</a> on what you'd like to see implemented first. We'll be adding Google maps and location-based searches soon. We also think it would be great to search events by event type/category or cost, so you can easily find out about tap takeovers by your favourite brewery, new beer releases, or beer and food pairing events for a nice night out. If you have any other suggestions, let us know!</p>
